          This is a demo [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com) application written by me, [Gerard Condon](http://www.gerardcondon.com). It was written as a way to learn Ruby, Bootstrap and Middleman in a practical manner. Blog posts detailing the creation of the site will be written and linked to from here.
